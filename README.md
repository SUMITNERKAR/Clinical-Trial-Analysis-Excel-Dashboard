Clinical Trial Data Analysis


Clinical trials are the backbone of medical innovation, but inefficiencies such as lengthy durations, adverse event monitoring, and resource allocation challenges often impede progress. To address these, I conducted an in-depth analysis of clinical trial data and uncovered key insights to optimize trial performance.

🔍 Key Insights:
1️⃣ Trial Distribution:

40% of trials are in Phase 3, focusing on efficacy testing.
Early phases (1 & 2) make up 35%, while post-approval (Phase 4) accounts for 25%.
2️⃣ Participant Demographics:

Average participants per trial: 500.
Oncology trials lead with 700 participants per trial, while Neurology has the lowest at 250.
3️⃣ Adverse Events:

Average of 20 adverse events per trial.
Highest rate in Phase 3: 30 events per trial.
4️⃣ Geographic Trends:

North America dominates with 50% of trials, while Oncology leads therapeutic areas with 35% of total trials.
5️⃣ Trial Outcomes & Durations:

70% of trials show improvement, 20% no change, and 10% worsen.
Phase 3 trials take 24 months, whereas Phase 1 is completed in 12 months.
🛠️ Recommendations:
Streamline Phase 3 timelines to reduce trial duration.
Increase recruitment in underrepresented areas like Neurology.
Enhance adverse event monitoring in larger trials.
Expand trial locations to emerging regions for diverse data insights.
📊 Leveraging tools like Power BI, SQL, and Excel, I translated raw data into actionable insights, helping create strategies for a more efficient and effective clinical trial process.

🌟 Clinical trials hold the promise of better health outcomes for all. By utilizing data-driven approaches, we can accelerate progress and bring life-saving treatments to patients faster.
